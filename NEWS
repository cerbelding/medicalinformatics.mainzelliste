Version 1.2
	-A field can now be defined but not used for matching (i.e. stored only).

	-Fixed wrong display of month of birth on the result page (contributed by Daniel Volk).

	 the documentation files for details.
	-Fixed NullPointerException and "Internal Server Error" on deleting a session that does not exist.
	-A bug in EpiLinkMatcher lead to overestimation of matching weights, which could lead to false 
	 matches in some cases (reported by Dirk Langner).
