Version 1.3
	-A documentation of the Mainzelliste interface is now available (not in English, yet)
		-> see Mainzelliste_Schnittstelle.pdf
	-The new interface version 2.0 introduces:
		-Issue "readPatient" tokens to fetch existing patients' IDs and IDAT via GET requests
		-A special template variable to reference token IDs in browser redirects
		-Several id types can be created at once. Specify them as "idTypes" when requesting the 
		 "addPatient" token.
		-The callback now submits every ID requested in the addPatient token.
		-The same goes for POST /patients using JSON format (Accept: application/json)
	-Bugfixes:
		-Fixed an error in record linkage causing a false positive for a combination of the same 
		 surname, different given names and empty birth dates (reported by Benjamin Gathmann).
		-The session timeout specified in the config file was interpreted as seconds rather than
		 minutes.
		-The callback did not work as documented (reported by Michael Storck).
		-The example configuration did not allow 'ÃŸ' as a valid character (reported by Benjamin
		 Gathmann).
		-Deleting invalid sessions raised a ConcurrentModificationException (reported by 
		 Stephan Rusch).

Version 1.2
	-A field can now be defined but not used for matching (i.e. stored only). 
	 This caused an exception in EpilinkMatcher in former versions.
	-Fixed wrong display of month of birth on the result page (contributed by Daniel Volk).
	-Sessions are now deleted if inactive for the amount of time specified by configuration property 
	 "sessionTimeout". A session is inactive as long as no request is made to it or its tokens. See
	 the documentation files for details.
	-Fixed NullPointerException and "Internal Server Error" on deleting a session that does not exist.
	-A bug in EpiLinkMatcher lead to overestimation of matching weights, which could lead to false 
	 matches in some cases (reported by Dirk Langner).

Version 1.1
	-Conversion to Maven Project (contributed by Jens Schwanke)
	-Added information to context.xml template for running the application from Netbeans
	-Removed control character and fixed missing umlauts in format for name fields in
	 configuration template (reported by Maximilian Ataian)
	-Fixed default path for configuration file
	-Fixed a bug in IDGeneratorMemory that caused database errors (duplicate primary key)
	 when using multiple ID types
	-Added startup code to convert database from 1.0 to 1.1 format
