Mainzelliste is a pseudonymization service originally created by the department for medical informatics
at the University Medical Center Mainz. It provides the following features:
	- A centralized repository for identifying data (IDAT) of patients, i.e. data such
	  as name, date of birth etc.
	- Record Linkage procedures to determine if a patient is already present in the database.
	- Generation of non-speaking pseudonmys for use in medical research networks.
	- Session and token handling for distributed and web-based applications.
	- A restful HTTP interface.
	
For detailed information, we refer to the included documentation.
